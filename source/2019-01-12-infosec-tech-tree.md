[As previously mentioned](https://rpavlov.com/2018/12/12/end-of-year/) my current aim is to secure (heh) a role somewhere within the large and complex field of information security. At the moment this means a ton of reading, introspection and looking to the future. Exactly what kind of work do I enjoy, and what are my options? What do I need to start doing now in order to get there this year? Let's start at a high level and drill down.
