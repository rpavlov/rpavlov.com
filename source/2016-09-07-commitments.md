title: Public commitments

Another one of those corny lifehacks I'm fond of is public commitments. I guess
it's semi-common knowledge that announcing your intentions publicly or better yet,
to friends, prompts action. I've also noticed it's useful for folks suffering from
depression and anxiety, insofar that making commitments to see friends or attend
events gets you out of the house.

With that in mind, I'm announcing my intention to pivot my career towards
automation and ops, plug some holes in my game and learn a few new tricks.
Luckily, like Arnold, my cpu is a neural net processor...a learning computah.

**Linux**

Despite using the terminal and interacting with servers almost daily, my
knowledge is broad but shallow. I'm getting a lot of mileage out of
[Unix for Mages](http://unixmages.com/ufbm.pdf) and
[Servers for hackers](https://serversforhackers.com/) 
as refreshers for things I don't normally do.

**Python**

The tool of choice for automation scripting.

**Ansible+Vagrant or Docker** 

Not sure which side to take yet, but for the time-being Ansible suits my needs
nicely. Shout-out to the mad genius [Shey](https://twitter.com/sheysewani) over at
[polymorphic.ca](https://polymorphic.ca) for putting me on this path and sharing some of his
hard-won knowledge and high quality scripts.
