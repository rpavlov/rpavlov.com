A site without content is like a skeleton without flesh. Decidedly useless. So, dear readers, here's what's fresh.

Back in September Phill over at [state.io](http://state.io/) subcontracted me to help out the cool people at [exclaim.ca](http://exclaim.ca/) iron out a few kinks with their concert listing site [concertsherpa.com](http://concertsherpa.com/).

It was a pleasure reading over some really well written and well thought-out code. I, *ahem*, appropriated a few clever snippets and tools, and picked up a handful of new best practices along the way. Thanks Phill & Co. !
