My thirst for knowledge is at an all-time high, and coupled with the catnip of personal productivity and organization, has led me to finally compile a (public) knowledge base. Previously I tried out the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) system but sort of couldn't get it to stick. Or rather, I failed to form a habit of building it out. Also, simply having all the markdown files in a repo didn't really inspire me to re-read or re-visit them in order to solidify learning. With tools like [Notion](https://notion.io), the ability to structure and change the layout of a page is really cool, but ultimately just got in the way of writing and served as a distraction. Hijacking the / character also just added more friction. 

I decided to give [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com) a shot, so you can now peep my notes over at [https://knowledge.rpavlov.com](https://knowledge.rpavlov.com)

Ultimately, what I am after is a stronger motivation to write more. Emptying my mind and consolidating+solidifying knowledge about various concepts is also a nice bonus. Finally, sharing useful information and learning also feels pretty good.
