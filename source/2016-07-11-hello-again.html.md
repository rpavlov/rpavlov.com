That's right, after 3.5 years of inactivity this blog lives again.

Such a long delay...but overcoming procrastination is Hard. To that end, some tricks that have helped me:

**Do the smallest possible task**

Start small and change 1 line of code. Wash 1 dish. Think about 1 thing. Almost always this snowballs into other tasks.

**Focus**

Obviously, right? But getting there is only half the trouble. Getting into flow is tricky and distractions are the mindkiller. F5'ing hackernews won't get anything finished.

**Visualize completing the task**

Aaah the sweetest feeling. Completing something, no matter how small, is a morale boost. Small increments lead to big changes.
