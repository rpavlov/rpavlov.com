I've been meaning to get into the process of taking notes while reading books. Lets start with Nonviolent Communication
by Marshall Rosenberg.

#### Surface thoughts

All communication must be grounded in a state of compassion towards the other person.

#### Four tenents of Nonviolent communication

1. Observe: I observe the situation or concrete actions.
2. Feeling: how the above observation makes me feel.
3. Needs: what needs/values/desires of ours are connected to the feelings we have identified.
4. Request: the concrete actions we request from the other person in order to enrich our lives.

#### Alienating types of communication

* Moralistic judgements (blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticisms, comparisons)
  * If my partner wants more affection than I’m giving her, she is “needy and dependent.” But if I want more affection than she is giving me,
  then she is “aloof and insensitive.”
* Denial of responsibility. We deny responsibility  for our actions when we attribute their
cause to
  * Our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history ( I drink because I am an alcoholic).
  * The actions of others. This is important in order to come across as accusatory.
  * The dictates of authority.
* Demands. You can never make a person do anything.

#### Separate observation from evaluation

* When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.
* Keep evaluations at bay: "John is angry" is an evaluation, "John shouted, pounded the table, etc..." is an observation.
Furthermore, he could in fact be hurt, scared or anxious.

#### Identify and express your own feelings

* But also, distinguish between feelings and thoughts. "I feel inadequate as a guitar player" is an assessment, instead of
"I feel impatient/disappointed/frustrated as a guitar player" which are feelings.
* Use words that refer to specific emotions, rather than something more general. "I feel good" could mean excited, mellow, etc..
* Distinguish between how you feel and how you think others are reacting to behaving towards you. "I feel misunderstood"
instead actually been anxious or annoyed.

#### Handling a negative message

You have four option when hearing something negative: "You're really self-centered and a trash-person"

* Take it personally, and accept others' judgement.
* Blame others. "Actually, you're the one who's self centered"
* ???
