For the past several months I've been pursuing a self-direct education in information security and immersing myself in a wealth of amazing topics. It's an incredibly broad field, and daunting in it's complexity but then what isn't. I figured writing about it would solidify some concepts and organize my thoughts.

My time currently mostly devoted to reading while I collect tools and provision a sandbox. I settled on this amazing
free course from the University of Helsinki for a more structured approach [https://cybersecuritybase.github.io/](https://cybersecuritybase.github.io/)
