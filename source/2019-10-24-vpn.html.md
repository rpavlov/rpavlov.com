Hey so it's taken way longer than it should have but I finally got around to hosting my own VPN. The setup itself was pretty easy thanks to the Ansible scripts and documentation provided by the [Algo project](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo).

Although it works fine with all major cloud providers, I was hoping to host it on a raspberry pi. Unfortunately, due to the sorry state of
ISPs here in Germany, my 2 in 1 modem/router lacks basic functionality like port forwarding, bridge mode, or the ability to use other firmware. [Pi VPN](http://www.pivpn.io/) is another excellent project that simplifies this task, assuming you have the ability to port forward.
