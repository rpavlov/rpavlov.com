The other day my lovely and charming girlfriend urged me to try out this personality test she found, pointing out that it was pretty damn accurate. Reading over her results, I had to agree they were spot on. Not gonna lie, back in the days of spark.com I'd kill hours doing their surveys, and had more fun filling out questionnaires on OkCupid than I did finding love.

Not surprisingly, it turns out I'm [Vladimir Putin](http://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality)! My strengths include directness, self-confidence, independence and decisiveness. Weaknesses include arrogance, over-analyzing and being a judgemental prick. Me in a nutshell.
