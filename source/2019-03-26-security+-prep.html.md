I finally got around to some focused self-study and completed a [https://stackskills.com](https://stackskills.com) course for the Security+ certification preparation. The tl;dr is that it's all pretty introductory/high-level subject matter, but still useful for getting into that headspace. Peep my notes here if you're so inclined [https://github.com/rpavlov/security-plus-notes](https://github.com/rpavlov/security-plus-notes)
