title: emacs vs vim
published: true

After spending the better part of last year using emacs (specifically the spacemacs distribution) before switching to neovim I can safely conclude I've shaved enough yaks to last me a lifetime. I'm switching back to Atom because
configuring editors is a waste of time that could be better spent actually building things. I could be meticulously
installing and configuring packages for crucial features like fuzzy project search, OR I could just use a modern editor.

Luckily most of the emacs navigation keybindings work in atom. God bless.
