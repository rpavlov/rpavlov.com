<p>Barely a day goes by now where I don&rsquo;t discover a bug in some service, tool or program. Sometimes it&rsquo;s even the default configuration that&rsquo;s wrong. Anyway, this one is a blog post because it&rsquo;s about Github pages where this blog lives.</p>

<p>I noticed the site was 404ing after I made the repository itself private. I reverted that, but still seeing a 404. I hadn&rsquo;t deployed any code changes either. I ruled it out an issue with the custom domain name because https://rpavlov.github.io was also 404.</p>

<p>Of course, others out there have had this same problem on and off since 2012 (According to the top answer on Stackoverflow).  The solution is to delete and re-push your remote <code>gh-pages</code> branch. Pretty lame solution. Possible bug on Github&rsquo;s end, according to comments.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code>git checkout gh-pages

git push origin <span class="nt">--delete</span> gh-pages

git push origin
</code></pre></div>
<p>It appears the option to have a private repo with public github pages is graciously on offer as a paid feature by GH.</p>
